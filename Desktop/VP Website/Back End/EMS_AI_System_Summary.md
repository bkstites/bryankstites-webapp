- **üìä Triage Scoring**: 0-10 scale based on urgency indicators and vital signs
- **üö® Urgency Classification**: CRITICAL, URGENT, MODERATE, LOW, MINIMAL levels
- **üíì Vital Signs Detection**: Automatic extraction of BP, HR, RR, O2 sat, etc.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Urgency Indicators**: Detection of cardiac, trauma, stroke, respiratory issues
- **üìã Protocol Matching**: Cosine similarity matching against known protocols
- **üí° Recommendations**: AI-generated recommendations based on analysis

### Machine Learning Components
- **Multi-class classification** for protocol categorization
- **Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression** models
- **Automatic model selection** based on performance
- **Model persistence** for deployment

## üìÅ Files Created

### Core System Files
1. **`ems_ai_triage_system.py`** - Main system with keyword association and triage logic
2. **`ems_data_preprocessing.py`** - Data preprocessing and training pipeline

- **Minor Injury**: Properly classified lower urgency cases

### Keyword Extraction Performance
- Successfully extracted relevant medical keywords from narratives
- Identified urgency indicators (cardiac, trauma, respiratory, neurological)
- Detected vital signs patterns (BP, HR, RR, O2 sat)

### Protocol Matching
- Successfully matched narratives to appropriate protocols
- Calculated similarity scores for protocol recommendations
- Integrated with triage scoring system
