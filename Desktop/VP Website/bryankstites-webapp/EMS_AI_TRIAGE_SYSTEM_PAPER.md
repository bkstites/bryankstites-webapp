## 1. Introduction

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers face critical time constraints and complex decision-making scenarios that require rapid assessment and intervention. Traditional protocol-based approaches rely on manual pattern recognition and may miss subtle clinical indicators. This paper presents an enhanced EMS AI Triage System that leverages machine learning and natural language processing to provide real-time clinical decision support.

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Prehospital care providers must rapidly assess patients, identify critical conditions, and implement appropriate interventions based on standardized protocols. The complexity of patient presentations, combined with time pressure and environmental factors, creates opportunities for cognitive errors and missed diagnoses (Croskerry, 2009). Automated clinical decision support systems have shown promise in reducing diagnostic errors and improving patient outcomes (Sutton et al., 2020).

### 1.2 Research Objectives

1. Develop an AI-powered system for analyzing EMS patient narratives
2. Integrate Pennsylvania State BLS protocols with machine learning algorithms
3. Provide real-time protocol recommendations based on clinical indicators
4. Evaluate system accuracy across diverse clinical scenarios
5. Assess clinical relevance and usability for prehospital providers

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

The EMS AI Triage System employs a modular architecture consisting of three primary components:

1. **Natural Language Processing Engine**: Processes patient narratives using TF-IDF vectorization and advanced text preprocessing
2. **Protocol Matching Engine**: Matches clinical indicators to Pennsylvania State BLS protocols using fuzzy string matching
3. **Clinical Decision Support Engine**: Generates evidence-based recommendations using weighted scoring algorithms

### 2.2 Technical Implementation

#### 2.2.1 Enhanced Text Preprocessing

The system implements a sophisticated text preprocessing pipeline:

```python
def preprocess_text(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Enhanced text preprocessing with medical terminology expansion"""
    # Expand medical abbreviations and synonyms
    text = self.expand_medical_terms(text)
    
    # Convert to lowercase and remove special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^\w\s\-\.]', ' ', text.lower())
    
    # Tokenize and lemmatize
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    processed_tokens = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token not in self.stop_words and len(token) > 2:
            lemmatized = self.lemmatizer.lemmatize(token)
            processed_tokens.append(lemmatized)
    
    return ' '.join(processed_tokens)
```

#### 2.2.2 Medical Terminology Expansion

The system maintains comprehensive medical synonym dictionaries:

```python
medical_synonyms = {
    'mi': ['myocardial infarction', 'heart attack', 'cardiac event'],
    'cva': ['stroke', 'cerebrovascular accident', 'brain attack'],
    'copd': ['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'emphysema'],
    'spo2': ['oxygen saturation', 'pulse oximetry', 'o2 sat'],
    'bp': ['blood pressure', 'systolic', 'diastolic'],
    'hr': ['heart rate', 'pulse', 'bpm'],
    'rr': ['respiratory rate', 'breathing rate', 'respirations']
}
```

#### 2.2.3 Urgency Assessment Algorithm

The system employs a weighted scoring algorithm for urgency assessment:

```python
def assess_urgency_level(self, text: str) -> Tuple[str, float]:
    """Enhanced urgency assessment with medical standards"""
    urgency_scores = {'critical': 0, 'high': 0, 'moderate': 0, 'low': 0}
    
    # Check each urgency level and category
    for urgency_level, categories in self.urgency_keywords.items():
        for category, keywords in categories.items():
            for keyword in keywords:
                if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(keyword) + r'\b', text_lower):
                    # Weight by urgency level
                    if urgency_level == 'critical':
                        urgency_scores['critical'] += 3
                    elif urgency_level == 'high':
                        urgency_scores['high'] += 2
                    elif urgency_level == 'moderate':
                        urgency_scores['moderate'] += 1
                    else:
                        urgency_scores['low'] += 0.5
    
    # Adjust with vital signs
    vitals = self._extract_vital_signs(text)
    urgency_scores = self._adjust_urgency_with_vitals(urgency_scores, vitals)
    
    return self._determine_final_urgency(urgency_scores)
```

### 2.3 Protocol Integration

The system integrates Pennsylvania State BLS protocols with enhanced matching capabilities:

#### 2.3.1 Respiratory Distress Protocol

```python
{
    "name": "PA Respiratory Distress Protocol",
    "text": """PA RESPIRATORY DISTRESS PROTOCOL
Assessment:
- Oxygen saturation monitoring
- Respiratory rate assessment
- Breath sounds evaluation
- Accessory muscle use assessment
- Tripoding position evaluation

Interventions:
- Oxygen Therapy: NRB mask at 15 LPM or nasal cannula at 2-6 LPM
- CPAP: Evaluate for CPAP if patient meets criteria (SpO2 < 90%, RR > 25)
- Assisted Inhaler: Administer albuterol via nebulizer or MDI
- Positioning: Keep patient in position of comfort (tripoding)
- Monitoring: Continuous pulse oximetry and respiratory rate
- ALS Activation: Consider for severe respiratory distress
- Advanced Airway: Prepare for potential intubation if needed""",
    "keywords": ["respiratory", "breathing", "oxygen", "distress", "cpap", 
                 "transport", "shortness of breath", "wheezing", "asthma", 
                 "copd", "tripoding", "accessory muscles", "nasal flaring", 
                 "nrb", "albuterol", "nebulizer"]
}
```

#### 2.3.2 Fuzzy String Matching

The system employs fuzzy string matching for improved protocol recall:

```python
def _calculate_similarity(self, keyword: str, text: str) -> float:
    """Calculate similarity using difflib SequenceMatcher"""
    return SequenceMatcher(None, keyword.lower(), text.lower()).ratio()

def find_protocol_matches(self, text: str, protocols: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Enhanced protocol matching with fuzzy logic"""
    matches = []
    
    for protocol_name, protocol_data in protocols.items():
        match_score = 0.0
        matched_keywords = []
        
        # Check keywords with fuzzy matching
        for keyword in protocol_data.get('keywords', []):
            similarity = self._calculate_similarity(keyword, text)
            if similarity > 0.1:  # Lower threshold for better recall
                match_score += similarity
                matched_keywords.append(keyword)
        
        if match_score > 0:
            matches.append({
                'protocol_name': protocol_name,
                'match_score': min(match_score, 1.0),
                'matched_keywords': matched_keywords
            })
    
    return sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x['match_score'], reverse=True)
```
